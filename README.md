# ü§ñ Nivuus Agent: Your Proactive AI Assistant for Linux

**Nivuus Agent is an autonomous and proactive AI assistant, powered by the OpenAI API, designed to run locally on your Linux system. Its mission: to deeply understand, maintain, and improve your system, while ensuring you remain in control.**

## üöÄ Quick Start

1.  **Prerequisites:** Node.js (v18+), npm, and an OpenAI API key.
2.  **Clone (if needed) & Install:**
    ```bash
    # git clone <your_repo_url> # If cloning
    # cd nivuus-agent
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure API Key:**
    *   **Recommended Method:** Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YourKeyHere
        ```
    *   *Alternative:* Directly modify `src/config.js` (less secure).
4.  **Launch the Agent:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The agent will start, potentially analyze your system, and then wait for your instructions or propose actions.

## ‚ú® Why Nivuus Agent?

*   **Intelligent Autonomy:** Explores and analyzes your system without constant intervention.
*   **Proactivity:** Doesn't just react; it identifies potential issues (bugs, performance, security) and *proposes* solutions.
*   **User Control:** **No system command is executed without your explicit confirmation.** You stay in charge.
*   **Persistent Memory:** Learns and remembers key information about your system between sessions.
*   **Adaptability:** Understands French and English.
*   **Extensible:** Easy to customize and extend with new tools and capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

*   **In-Depth System Discovery:** Explores hardware, OS, software, network...
*   **Bug Detection & Correction:** Identifies errors and misconfigurations, proposes fixes (with confirmation).
*   **Performance Optimization:** Analyzes and suggests improvements (with confirmation).
*   **Security Enhancement:** Assesses security posture and proposes hardening measures (with confirmation).
*   **Feature Suggestion:** Proposes improvements based on analysis.
*   **Integrated Tools:**
    *   Shell Command Execution (controlled and with confirmation via `run_bash_command`).
    *   File Reading (`read_file`).
    *   Web Search (`web_search` via DuckDuckGo).
    *   Directory Listing (`list_directory`).
    *   File Writing (controlled and with confirmation via `write_file`).
*   **History & Memory:** Retains conversation (`conversation_history.json`) and system information (`agent_memory.json`).
*   **Localization:** Interface in French/English.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  Loads state (history, memory).
2.  Sends context (history, memory summary, system prompt, user instruction) to the OpenAI API.
3.  The AI analyzes and decides to:
    *   Respond with text.
    *   Autonomously use an information tool (`read_file`, `list_directory`, `web_search`).
    *   Propose an action requiring confirmation (`run_bash_command`, `write_file`).
4.  If an autonomous tool is used, the result is added to history, and the AI is called again.
5.  If an action with confirmation is proposed:
    *   The corresponding tool function (`runCommand`, `writeFileWithConfirmation`) asks for your approval.
    *   The action is executed or canceled based on your response.
    *   The result is added to history, and the AI is called again.
6.  The AI generates a final text response if needed.
7.  The loop continues.

## üîß Customization

*   **Core Behavior:** Modify `default_system_prompt_template` in `src/config.js`.
*   **AI Model:** Change `MODEL_NAME` in `src/config.js`.
*   **Tools:** Add/modify functions in `src/tools.js`.
*   **Languages:** Adapt `src/locales.js`.

## Project Files

*   `index.js`: Entry point.
*   `package.json`: Metadata and dependencies.
*   `.env` (to be created): For securely storing the API key.
*   `conversation_history.json`: Dialogue.
*   `agent_memory.json`: Persistent memory.
*   `src/`: Main logic (agent, config, locales, tools, utils).
*   `docs/`: Documentation and resources (like `screenshot.png`).
